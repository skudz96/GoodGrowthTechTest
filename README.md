# üå¶Ô∏è Weather Widget ‚Äì Good Growth Tech Test
This mini project adds a real-time weather forecast to [The National Trust's property pages](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/warwickshire/packwood-house). It automatically detects the property's location and displays the upcoming local weather (over the next 24 hours) in a clear, visual format - ideal for helping visitors plan their trip.
By quietly adding this info to the existing page layout, the widget enhances the user experience without disrupting the site's design. Only one request is made to the API to keep things efficient and fast.
If you'd like to demo, simply copy the contents of goodgrowth.js, head to [this link](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/warwickshire/packwood-house), press Ctrl + Shift + I to open up the dev tools, paste into the console, and hit enter.
